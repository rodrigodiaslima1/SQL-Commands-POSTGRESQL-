<h1>SQL Commands (PostgreSQL)</h1>

<p><em>This repository is dedicated to store a brief list of basic commands used
in the SGBD PostgreSQL. Although we have available frameworks that help us work
with it in the back-end, during my studies, I felt the need to have a handy list
through some exercises.</em></p>
